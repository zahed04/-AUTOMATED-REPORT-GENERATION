DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:
Tools & Libraries Used:
pandas:

Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis.

Used For: Reading CSV data, aggregating totals, computing averages, and identifying the top-performing product.

StringIO from io module:

Purpose: Simulates a file object from a string.

Used For: Converting the multi-line string (csv_data) into a format readable by pandas.read_csv.

FPDF from fpdf library:

Purpose: PDF generation and formatting.

Used For: Creating a styled PDF report that includes headers, footers, sections, and formatted text.

sum(): Adds all units sold and revenue values.

mean(): Averages daily revenue.

groupby(...).sum(): Totals revenue by product.

idxmax(): Gets the product with the highest total revenue.

This class inherits from FPDF and adds:

a. üè∑Ô∏è header(self):
Adds "Sales Report" at the top of each page.

b. ü¶∂ footer(self):
Displays page numbers at the bottom of each page.

c. üìå section_title(self, title):
Adds a bold section header.

d. ‚úçÔ∏è section_body(self, text):
Adds paragraph-style body content under a section.

 Final Output
File Generated: sales_report_embedded.pdf
Contents:

Header: ‚ÄúSales Report‚Äù

Summary Section:

Total Units Sold

Total Revenue

Average Revenue/Day

Top-Selling Product

Daily Sales Breakdown

What You Learn from This Script
How to simulate file input using StringIO.

Basic data aggregation in pandas.

How to create and style PDF reports using fpdf.

How to structure code with classes and methods for clean logic separation.

Combining analytics and reporting in one pipeline ‚Äî perfect for automated reporting systems.

Used For:

Reading CSV Data: The read_csv() function reads structured CSV data into a DataFrame, making it easy to analyze.

Aggregating Totals: Methods like .sum() are used to calculate the total units sold and total revenue.

Computing Averages: .mean() computes the average revenue over the dataset.

Group Analysis: groupby() combined with .sum() is used to total revenue by product.

Identifying Top Products: idxmax() helps identify which product generated the highest revenue.

2. StringIO from io module
Purpose: StringIO allows you to treat strings as file-like objects.

Used For:

It converts the CSV-formatted string (csv_data) into a stream that can be passed to pandas.read_csv(), simulating reading from an actual .csv file.

3. FPDF from fpdf library
Purpose: FPDF is a lightweight PDF generation library that allows for precise layout control.

Used For:

Creating well-structured PDF reports.

Adding headers, footers, section titles, and multi-line text formatting.

Exporting data analytics into a readable document format
